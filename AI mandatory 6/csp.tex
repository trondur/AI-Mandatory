\begin{description}
	\item[$C_{X1X5}$] We can remove $3$ from $D_{1}$ since $D_5$ only contains 1 and 2 which only allow 1 or 2 for $X_1$.
	\item[$C_{X1X2}$] We can remove $5$ from $D_{2}$ since $D_1$ only contains 1 and 2.
	\item[$C_{X2X4}$] We can remove $7$ from $D_{2}$ since $D_2$ only contains 7 and 8.
	\item[$C_{X2X3}$] We can remove $1$ and $2$ from $D_{3}$ since $D_2$ only contains 8.
\end{description}


$D_1 = \{2\}, D_2 = \{8\}, D_4 = \{4\}, D_4 = \{0, 2\}, D_5 = \{1\}$
\subsection{2}


$X_1 = 1, X_2 = 8, X_3 = 4, X_4 = 0, X_5 = 2$
