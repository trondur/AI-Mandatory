\subsection{1}


\begin{description}
	\item[$C_{X1X5}$] We can remove $3$ from $D_{1}$ since $D_5$ only contains 1 and 2 which only allow 1 or 2 for $X_1$.
	\item[$C_{X1X2}$] We can remove $5$ from $D_{2}$ since $D_1$ only contains 1 and 2.
	\item[$C_{X2X4}$] We can remove $7$ from $D_{2}$ since $D_2$ only contains 7 and 8.
	\item[$C_{X2X3}$] We can remove $1$ and $2$ from $D_{3}$ since $D_2$ only contains 8.
\end{description}


$D_1 = \{2\}, D_2 = \{8\}, D_4 = \{4\}, D_4 = \{0, 2\}, D_5 = \{1\}$
\subsection{2}


$X_1 = 1, X_2 = 8, X_3 = 4, X_4 = 0, X_5 = 2$

\subsection{3}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Apply revise to all arcs from the bottom up.
	\item Assign the root variable to any value in its current domain and further shrink its domain to only one value -- the one we assigned to it.
	\item Apply revise to all arcs from the root node.
	\item Repeat step 2 and 3 for all the root nodes children until we reach the bottom of the tree.
\end{itemize}
